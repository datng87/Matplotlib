# Matplotlib
This is an activity in which I used Pandas and Matplotlib to analyse and visualise the data of a study on mouse tumours. 

In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumour growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumour development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

Jupiter Notebook is used to capture the calculations and charts.
